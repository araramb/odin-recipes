# odin-recipes
HTML Odin Project 
In this first Odin project, I utilized skills learned from HTML in order to create a very bare and basic webpage containing information on three different recipes of my choosing. Choosing recipes I enjoy made it more fun and my comprehension and understanding of using base HTML language is definitely further cemented.
